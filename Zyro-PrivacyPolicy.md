# Privacy Policy of Zyro

**By Using [Zyro](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=877815459624411147&permissions=1102468931703&scope=bot%20applications.commands), We hope You Accept to the Privacy Policy of the bot too**

```
1. What Type of Data We Store? (Explained)
```
> - At first the data we use like **User Levels/XPs** for that we require the **Guild IDs** since leveling is only made for the server you use the bot in.. That means the **Levels/XPs** Whats being displayed when you use `/rank` or `/leaderboard` will not show the same in other server. 
>
> - And next comes the **User IDs** As I told above **Levels/XPs** need Guild IDs and it requires the User IDs too because we store the **Levels/XPs** data in the user ID in the database, and yes **Economy** of Zyro is also included in this.. in economy there are commands which require userIDs.. example: `/daily`, `/weekly`, `/monthly`, `/yearly` etc. These commands use the **User IDs** and also some more which require them. so yeah 
```
2. Who Can Access The Data Stored By the BOT?
```
> - You might be thinking who can access all of the data shown above, don't worry we don't leak your data and its kept safe in the database!
> 
> - Your data can't and won't be used maliciously and only the bot **Owner** who is [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) can only access it so that its safe!
```
3. Does the Stored Data get Shared or something?
```
> - Many of you might be thinking that we share this data, leak it and hack accounts.. No, **We Don't do that**!
> 
> - We keep the data safe very safe with extra protection and yes The BOT owner who is [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) also doesn't check it often
> 
> - [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) checks it rarely when adding new features to the bot, and when the data was stored by mistake by new features they try to correct them and make the features work, and **NOTE** they don't check the data of `economy`, `Levels/Xps` or other commands which were made long ago, but only the new commands which are being made!
```
4. How does the BOT use the Stored Data
```
> - As its mentioned above (again), We use the data accordingly stored when used the command by the user
> 
> - Which means when a user executes `/daily` or `/profile` we fetch the data from the database and the bot responds accordingly
> 
> - Also, Yes We save the data in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), So when people use the command (mentioned above), we can **Fetch the Data** Respectively and sent when executed the specific command.
```
5. How can I Delete the Data Stored by Zyro?
```
> - Hmm.. One idea üí°! You can contact the Zyro's Owner [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064)!
> 
> - üòÖ 2 ideas actually.. Second one: **You can Open a Ticket in the** [Support Server](https://discord.gg/Pc96dVS6tS) **and ping** [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064)!
> 
> - Hey listen spamming will get you banned but no problem maybe ping [·èù 8 ·è¶ ·é•#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) in DMs? they can handle it ;)
