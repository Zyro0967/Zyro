                                                                     First comes: - What We Store?
```
> - At first the data we use like **User Levels/XPs** for that we require the **Guild IDs** since leveling is only made for the server you use the bot in.. That means the **Levels/XPs** Whats being displayed when you use `/rank` or `/leaderboard` will not show the same in other server. 
>
> - And next comes the **User IDs** As I told above **Levels/XPs** need Guild IDs and it requires the User IDs too because we store the **Levels/XPs** data in the user ID in the database, and yes **Economy** of Zyro is also included in this.. in economy there are commands which require userIDs.. example: `/daily`, `/weekly`, `/monthly`, `/yearly` etc. These commands use the **User IDs** and also some more which require them. so yeah

                                                                    Second of all: - Who Can Access It?
```
> - You might be thinking who can access all of the data shown above, don't worry we don't leak your data and its kept safe in the database!
> - Your data can't and won't be used maliciously and only the bot **Owner** who is [Ꮭ 8 Ꮶ Ꭵ#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) can only access it so that its safe!

```
                                                                    Third: - Do we share the stored data?
```
> - Many of you might be thinking that we share this data, leak it and hack accounts.. No, **We Don't do that**!
> - We keep the data safe very safe with extra protection and yes The BOT owner who is [Ꮭ 8 Ꮶ Ꭵ#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) also doesn't check it often
> - [Ꮭ 8 Ꮶ Ꭵ#6658](https://discord.com/users/872442836166017064) checks it rarely when adding new features to the bot, and when the data was stored by mistake by new features they try to correct them and make the features work, and **NOTE** they don't check the data of `economy`, `Levels/Xps` or other commands which were made long ago, but only the new commands which are being made!

```
                                                                    Forth Yet: How we use the data?
```
> - 
> - We save the data in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), So when people use the Command we can **Fetch the Data** Respectively.

```
                                                                    Last Here Comes: How can I delete my data?
